## Chest X-Ray Classification to detect COVID-19 using Deep Neural Networks

Millions of people have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality. 
Chest radiography is one of the quick and accessible diagnostic techniques for detecting COVID-19.<br/> 
The project aims to develop a reliable method for detecting COVID-19 in patients by analyzing chest X-rays.<br/>
CNN is being used for detecting COVID-19 in patients on a Chest Radiography dataset to detect COVID-19-affected areas in the lungs.<br/>

This project aims to develop a quick and accurate diagnostic method using deep learning techniques to detect COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses.<br/>
We developed a deep-learning model that can classify chest X-ray images into 2 groups: COVID ,  non-COVIDinfection to train the models. These models can be utilized in the detection of respiratory illnesses, especially COVID-19.<br/>

## Conclusion
The model has performed well with an accuracy of 90.4%, indicating that it correctly classified 90.4% of the total instances.<br/>
The precision of 90.1% indicates that when it predicts a positive outcome, it is correct 90.1% of the time.<br/><br/>
The recall of 96.3% indicates that it correctly identifies 96.3% of all actual positive instances.<br/>
The F1 score, which considers both precision and recall, is 93.1%, indicating a good balance between the two metrics.<br/>
