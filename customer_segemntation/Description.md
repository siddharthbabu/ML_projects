Customer Segmentation for Marketing Data Using KMeans Clustering

Project Overview:<br />
This project focuses on segmenting customers for targeted marketing strategies using KMeans clustering. The dataset contains various features such as customer demographics, purchase history, and interactions with marketing campaigns.

Methodology:<br />
-Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and processed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.<br />
-Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected for customer segmentation based on their importance and relevance to marketing strategies.<br />
-KMeans Clustering: The KMeans algorithm is applied to cluster customers into distinct groups based on their feature similarities.<br />
-Cluster Analysis: The characteristics of each cluster are analyzed to understand the different customer segments and their unique traits.<br />
-Marketing Strategies: Targeted marketing strategies are developed for each customer segment based on their preferences and behavior.<br />

Key Features:<br />
Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income, etc.<br />
Purchase History: Total spend, frequency of purchases, etc.<br />
