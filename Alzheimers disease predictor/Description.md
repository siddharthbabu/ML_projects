## Alzheimer's Disease Classification Model</br> 
### Introduction</br> 
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide.</br> 
Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving patient outcomes and facilitating timely interventions. </br> 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying individuals with Alzheimer's disease and distinguishing them from healthy individuals.</br> 

### Model Summary</br> 
The Alzheimer's classification model is built using a deep learning approach with the help of TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and seaborn packages.</br> 
The model leverages a multimodal dataset, including neuroimaging data, genetic information, and clinical variables, to capture comprehensive information about each individual.</br> 
By incorporating advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.</br> 

### Dataset</br> 
For this project, we are using a publicly available Kaggle Dataset that has 6400 data points categorized into 4 classes:

Moderate Demented</br> 
Non Demented</br> 
Very Mild Demented</br> 
Mild Demented</br> 

The dataset is divided into 80% training and 20% testing sets. The training set is further split into 80% training and 20% validation sets. The dataset is available at the following link: Kaggle Dataset Link</br> 

### Conclusion</br> 
The model was able to accurately classify the images into the 4 classes with 93% accuracy.</br> 
The model can be further improved by using a larger dataset and by using more advanced deep learning techniques. </br> 
The model can also be used to classify other types of images into multiple classes.</br>
