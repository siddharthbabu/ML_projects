## Telecom Churn Prediction

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains various features related to customer demographics, services subscribed, and billing information.

Key Features:<br />
Gender: Gender of the customer.<br />
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not.<br />
Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not.<br />
Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not.<br />
Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.<br />
PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service or not.<br />
MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines or not.<br />
InternetService: Type of internet service subscribed by the customer.<br />
OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security or not.<br />
OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup or not.<br />
DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection or not.<br />
TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support or not.<br />
StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not.<br />
StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies or not.<br />
Contract: Type of contract subscribed by the customer.<br />
PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing or not.<br />
PaymentMethod: Payment method used by the customer.<br />
MonthlyCharges: Monthly charges paid by the customer.<br />
TotalCharges: Total charges paid by the customer.<br />
Churn: Whether the customer churned or not (target variable).<br />

Methodology:<br />
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and encoded for use in machine learning models.<br />
Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected for predicting churn.<br />
Model Training: Decision tree, random forest, and KNN classifiers are trained on the dataset.<br />
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br />
Results: The best performing model is selected for predicting customer churn.<br />

Technologies Used:<br />
Python<br />
pandas<br />
scikit-learn<br />
Jupyter Notebook<br />

Repository Contents:<br />
Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code.<br />
Dataset used for training and testing the models.<br />
